# Biomedical Entity Linking

This repo provides the code for the paper [BERT might be Overkill: A Tiny but Effective Biomedical Entity Linker based on Residual Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02237.pdf) (EMNLP 2021 Findings). We are cleaning the codebase and we will add more running instructions soon.
